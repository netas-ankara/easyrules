## What is Easy Rules?

Easy Rules is a Java rules engine inspired by an article called *"[Should I use a Rules Engine?](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RulesEngine.html)"* of [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) in which Martin says:

> You can build a simple rules engine yourself. All you need is to create a bunch of objects with conditions and actions, store them in a collection, and run through them to evaluate the conditions and execute the actions.

This is exactly what Easy Rules does, it provides the `Rule` abstraction to create rules with conditions and actions, and the `RulesEngine` API that runs through a set of rules to evaluate conditions and execute actions.

## Core features

 * Lightweight library and easy to learn API
 * POJO based development with annotation programming model
 * Useful abstractions to define business rules and apply them easily with Java
 * The ability to create composite rules from primitive ones

## Example

##### First, define your rule..

```java
@Rule(name = "my awesome rule" )
public class MyRule {

    @Condition
    public boolean when() {
        return true;
    }
    
    @Action
    public void then() {
        System.out.println("Easy Rules rocks!");
    }
}
```

##### Then, fire it!

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create a rules engine
        RulesEngine rulesEngine = aNewRulesEngine().build();
        //register the rule
        rulesEngine.registerRule(new MyRule());
        //fire rules
        rulesEngine.fireRules();
    }
}
```

This is the hello world of Easy Rules. You can find other examples like the [FizzBuzz tutorial](http://www.easyrules.org/tutorials/fizzbuzz-tutorial.html) in the documentation.
